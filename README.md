# Job-Scheduler
A project that makes use of the Binary Search Tree data structure to allow users to create a job schedule.

This project is implemented using Python3.

Companies and people always have a list of jobs or tasks that they aspire to complete in a day.
This program maintains the scheduling of these daily jobs. 
The program is also dynamic: New jobs can be scheduled and completed ones can be removed.
There are a basic number of jobs that are fed to the program whenit starts. These jobs are added in the `dataa.txt` file
